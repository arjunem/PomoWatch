- **Success Rate**: 60%

## Detailed Test Results

### ✅ PASSED Test Cases

#### Test Case 1.1: Start Break/Work Session
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED
- **Result**: Current session gets an entry and is shown correctly
- **Details**: 
  - Work and break sessions start properly
  - Current session display shows correct session type and duration
  - Timer starts counting down appropriately

#### Test Case 2.1: Session Deletion
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED
- **Result**: Delete confirmation popup works and session is removed
- **Details**:
  - Delete modal appears with session details
  - Session is deleted from database on confirmation
  - Modal closes properly after deletion

#### Test Case 2.2: Clear All Sessions
- **Status**: ✅ PASSED
- **Result**: Clear all functionality works with confirmation
- **Details**:
  - Confirmation dialog appears before clearing
  - All sessions are deleted from database
  - Session list shows empty state after clearing

### ❌ FAILED Test Cases

#### Test Case 1.2: Stop/Reset Session
- **Status**: ❌ FAILED
- **Issue**: Recent sessions are not refreshed correctly on timer stop
- **Expected Behavior**: 
  - Stop the existing session
  - Save it to database
  - Refresh recent sessions list to show the last session
  - Clear current session
- **Actual Behavior**:
  - Current session is cleared correctly ✅
  - Session is saved to database ✅
  - Recent sessions list is NOT refreshed automatically ❌
  - Only refreshes when clicking on collapsible UI button ❌
- **Reproduction Steps**:
  1. Start a work or break session
  2. Let it run for a few seconds
  3. Click "Stop" button
  4. Observe that recent sessions list doesn't update
  5. Click on collapsible view button to see the session appear
- **Impact**: High - Users won't see their completed sessions immediately

#### Test Case 3.1: Statistics Updates
- **Status**: ❌ FAILED
- **Issue**: Total sessions count not updated immediately after deletion
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Today's progress statistics updated in real-time
  - Statistics reflect current session counts and durations
  - Progress bars and counters update immediately
- **Actual Behavior**:
  - Total sessions count is NOT affected immediately after deleting session ❌
  - Statistics only update when clicking on collapsible view button ❌
  - No real-time updates for session deletion ❌
- **Reproduction Steps**:
  1. Create multiple sessions
  2. Note the total sessions count in statistics
  3. Delete a session
  4. Observe that total sessions count doesn't change immediately
  5. Click on collapsible view button to see count update
- **Impact**: High - Statistics are misleading and not real-time

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Session List Refresh Problem
- **Component**: `SessionHistoryComponent`
- **Root Cause**: The `notifySessionChanged()` method from `TimerService` is not properly triggering the session list refresh when stopping sessions
- **Code Location**: `timer.service.ts` lines 299, 310, 322, 340
- **Issue**: Session change notifications are sent but `SessionHistoryComponent` may not be subscribing correctly or the refresh mechanism has a timing issue

### Issue 2: Statistics Update Problem
- **Component**: `SessionHistoryComponent` statistics section
- **Root Cause**: Statistics are not being recalculated when sessions are deleted, only when the collapsible view is toggled
- **Code Location**: `session-history.component.ts` statistics refresh logic
- **Issue**: The `getTodayStats()` method is not being called after session deletion operations

## Recommendations

### Priority 1 (Critical)
1. **Fix Session List Refresh**: Ensure `notifySessionChanged()` properly triggers session list refresh in all scenarios
2. **Fix Statistics Updates**: Implement real-time statistics updates for all session operations

### Priority 2 (High)
1. **Add Manual Refresh Button**: Provide a manual refresh option for users
2. **Improve Error Handling**: Add better error handling for failed refresh operations

### Priority 3 (Medium)
1. **Add Loading States**: Show loading indicators during refresh operations
2. **Add Auto-refresh**: Implement periodic auto-refresh for session lists

## Test Environment Details
- **Frontend**: Angular 17+ running on localhost:4201
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core 8.0 running on localhost:5001
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Browser**: Chrome 140.0.0.0
- **OS**: Windows 10 (WSL2)

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Session List Refresh Issue
- **Problem**: Recent sessions were not refreshing automatically when stopping timer
- **Solution**: Added a 100ms delay in session change notification to ensure backend operations complete
- **Code Changes**: 
  - Modified `SessionHistoryComponent.ngOnInit()` to add `setTimeout()` delay
  - Ensures `loadRecentSessions()` is called after backend operations complete

### Fix 2: Statistics Update Issue  
- **Problem**: Statistics were not updating immediately after session deletion
- **Solution**: Added dedicated `refreshStatistics()` method and call it after all session operations
- **Code Changes**:
  - Added `refreshStatistics()` method to `SessionHistoryComponent`
  - Called `refreshStatistics()` after session deletion and clear all operations
  - Added `cdr.detectChanges()` to trigger UI updates
  - Consolidated statistics refresh logic into single method

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Investigate and fix the session refresh mechanism
2. ✅ Implement proper statistics update triggers
3. **PENDING**: Re-test all scenarios after fixes
4. **PENDING**: Update test documentation with new results
